		<h1> What is AP African American Studies? </h1>
		</div>

		<div class="text">
		<p>Students explore key topics that extend from early African kingdoms to the ongoing challenges and achievements of the contemporary moment. Given the interdisciplinary character of African American studies, students in the course will develop skills across multiple fields, with an emphasis on developing historical, literary, visual, and data analysis skills. This course foregrounds a study of the diversity of Black communities in the United States within the broader context of Africa and the African diaspora.</p>

		<div  class="text">
		<p>AP African American Studies is designed to be the equivalent of an introductory college or university course in African American Studies and related courses, including Africana Studies, African Diaspora Studies, and Black Studies.</p>
		</div>
		
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<div class="text">
		<p>The course framework includes primary text, visual, and data sources for each topic that help teachers and students stay focused on the actual works and documents of African American studies rather than on extraneous political opinions or perspectives. In other words, anchoring the AP course in primary sources fosters an evidence-based learning environment.</p>
