		<h1> Why was the course in banned in Florida? </h1>
		</div>

		<div class="subTitle">
		<p> Florida's Department of Education has rejected an Advanced Placement course covering African American studies — saying the class indoctrinates students to "a political agenda."</p>

		<p>In January, the Florida Department of Education rejected the AP African American History course and provided a list of concerns about certain topics, including Movement for Black Lives, Black feminism, and reparations. The department also questioned the inclusion of certain authors and historians because the content of their writings revolved around “Critical Race Theory” and black communism. Apparently, the course violates Florida’s “Stop WOKE” Act, which regulates the content taught in schools in Florida. The Act regulates how race is taught in the classroom and lets parents sue teachers and districts that violate it. The department will reconsider the course if it is revised.</p>

		<p>However, banning the course does a disservice to all students, especially Black students, of Florida trying to receive a comprehensive education. People across the country should be concerned that legislators and governors across the country are going to do exactly what Florida is doing.</p>

		<p>The Black Lives Matter movement and Black queerness are not topics that should be shied away from. They are pivotal points in American history, and studying them gives students an understanding of injustices multiple groups of people face in the country.</p>

		<p>It is extremely important to learn about the multiple perspectives of people throughout history. By banning writings of pivotal people, Florida is erasing the various mindsets and ideas of significant points in history.</p>
