		<p> A revised curriculum for a new Advanced Placement course on African American studies downplays some components that drew criticism from conservatives (NPR)</p>

		<p>In response to recent comments made by a Florida official, the College Board issued an official statement denouncing the alleged spreading of misinformation about the AP course for political gain by the Florida Department of Education. The College Board also disputed the department's claims that they had exchanged emails over months to discuss the course and claimed credit for the changes College Board made to the framework. The College Board believes this move was done in an attempt to "engineer a political win."</p>

		<p>The College Board also acknowledged their failure to immediately denounce the DeSantis administration's comments that the course "lacks educational value." In light of this, they released their official framework for the AP course.</p>
		</div>
		
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<div  class="aloneText">
		<p>The official framework divides topics into four main units: "Origins of the African Diaspora," "Freedom, Enslavement and Resistance," "The Practice of Freedom," and "Movements and Debates." The framework was developed after consulting with over 300 professors of AA studies, including faculty from HBCUs.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="content">

		<div class="aloneText">
		<p>While the official framework does not include the Black Lives Matter movement or the case for reparations, two topics that the department raised concerns for, it still covers a wide range of important topics related to African American history and culture. The College Board hopes that this framework will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the African American experience and encourage further discussion and research on these important topics.</p>
